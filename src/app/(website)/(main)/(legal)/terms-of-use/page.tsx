              tracking), you may need to create an account (“Account”). When
              registering, you agree to:

              Cherlygood.com may suspend or terminate your Account if we believe
              your information is inaccurate or if you violate these Terms.
              Notify us immediately at{" "}
              <a href="mailto:support@cherlygood.com">support@cherlygood.com</a>{" "}

            <h4>(a) Ordering Process</h4>
            <p>
              When you place an order, you must provide accurate payment and
              shipping details. By submitting an order, you authorize us to
              share this information with third parties (e.g., payment
              processors, shipping providers) to process your purchase.
            </p>
            <h4>(b) Product Availability and Quantities</h4>
            <p>
              All products are subject to availability. We may limit quantities
              per order and reserve the right to refuse sales to resellers or
              cancel orders suspected of resale intent.
            </p>
            <h4>(c) Pricing</h4>
            <p>
              Prices are listed in USD and may change without notice. If a
              product is listed at an incorrect price (e.g., due to a typo), we
              may cancel the order, even if confirmed, and refund any payment
              made.
            </p>
            <h4>(d) Order Confirmation</h4>
            <p>
              An order confirmation email does not mean your order is accepted.
              We reserve the right to decline any order (e.g., due to stock
              issues or suspected fraud). Acceptance occurs when we send a
              shipping confirmation.
            </p>
            <h4>(e) Payment</h4>
            <p>
              You agree to pay the total amount, including taxes and shipping
              fees, at checkout. We accept [Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, and other
              methods as updated on the Sites]. If payment fails, you agree to
              settle any outstanding amounts upon request.
            </p>
            <h4>(f) Taxes and Customs</h4>
            <p>
              Sales taxes will be added at checkout for applicable regions. For
              international orders, you are responsible for all customs duties,
              taxes, and fees.
            </p>
